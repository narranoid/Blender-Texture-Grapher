# Texture Grapher

## Blender add-on organizing your texture sets in shader node trees.

**_Texture Grapher_'s primary feature is the automated texture set creation as node groups which it does through a texture naming analysis (this is not AI driven). To top it off, _Texture Grapher_ also features smart naming and color space assignment for assets, improved node organization, and auto-connect for related sockets. These features save time and effort, improve consistency, and make it easier to work with complex node setups.**

## Feature Overview

### Texture Set Setup

Automatically creates texture set node groups and frames out of images and image nodes. Saves time and enhances consistency in materials:

Automation is based on an general algorithm and not just matching static patterns.  
Has been tested successfully with texture sets from:

*   [Poly Haven (fka Texture Haven)](https://polyhaven.com/textures)
*   [Game Textures](https://gametextures.com/)
*   [Poliigon](https://www.poliigon.com/textures)
*   [sharetextures](https://www.sharetextures.com/)
*   [textures.com](https://www.textures.com/library)
*   [CGAXIS](https://cgaxis.com/)
*   [ambientCG (fka CC0 Textures)](https://ambientcg.com/)

### Naming & Color Spaces

Smartly names images, nodes, and node groups based on texture set name and texture types and applies proper color spaces:

### Organize Nodes

Offers layouting features and quick hide/unhide toggles for multiple nodes, making it easier to manage large sets of nodes and create organized and intuitive node arrangement:

### Connect Nodes

Automates the process of connecting nodes by detecting related sockets and connecting them. Saves time, particularly when working on complex node setups:  
  
**However, note that the auto-connect features can still be error-prone!
